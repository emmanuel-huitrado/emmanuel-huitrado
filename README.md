🎩 I'm Emmanuel Huitrado, I've been a Software Engineer for more than 15 years. Right now, I perform as a Principal Engineer and I'm in charge of a Center of Excellence. 

🏁 Most of my career I've worked with Java Frameworks but I have a wide experience with other tools and other roles. I performed for a while as a L3 support eng., BI specialist, Web Developer and Scrum Master. 

🏈 I love sports, 📖 books and 🎮 videogames.
